                <h3>üåê Core Components of HTML</h3>
                <p>
                    The core components of HTML are the fundamental building blocks that define the structure and
                    content of a webpage. Every HTML document begins with the root element called html, which acts as
                    the container for all other elements in the page. Inside this root element, the document is divided
                    into two main sections: the head and the body. The head section is not directly visible to the user
                    but contains essential information about the webpage such as its title, metadata, links to
                    stylesheets, and scripts. The body section, on the other hand, represents everything that is
                    displayed on the browser, including text, images, videos, hyperlinks, forms, tables, and other
                    interactive content.
                    <br><br>
                    Text components like headings, paragraphs, and formatting tags help organize and present content in
                    a readable way. Hyperlinks, created using the anchor tag, enable navigation between different web
                    pages or within the same document, making the web interconnected. Multimedia components such as
                    images, audio, and video enhance the visual and interactive experience of the webpage. Lists and
                    tables are also an important part of HTML, as they allow structured representation of information in
                    an organized format. Forms play a key role in user interaction, allowing input through text fields,
                    buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, and more, which makes websites dynamic and interactive.
                    <br><br>
                    With the introduction of HTML5, semantic elements like header, footer, section, article, and nav
                    have been added to give more meaningful structure to a webpage. These elements not only improve
                    readability for developers but also help search engines and assistive technologies understand the
                    purpose of each part of a page. Along with this, HTML supports scripting and styling components
                    where JavaScript can be embedded using the script tag to add dynamic behavior, and CSS can be
                    included either inline, internally, or externally using the style and link tags for better design
                    and layout. Altogether, these core components work in harmony to create complete, structured, and
                    interactive webpages.

                    Some of the important components are:
                <ul>
                    <li> Text components such as headings, paragraphs, and formatting tags that make the content
                        organized
                        and readable.</li>
                    <li> Hyperlinks that connect one webpage to another or even different parts of the same page,
                        creating
                        the web‚Äôs interconnected structure.
                    </li>
                    <li> Multimedia components like images, audio, and video that make websites more attractive and
                        interactive.
                    </li>
                    <li> Lists and tables that represent information in an ordered and structured manner.
                    </li>
                    <li> Forms that allow user input through text boxes, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, and
                        submit
                        buttons.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                .
